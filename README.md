# Frogger Web Game Project3 Udacity FEND
Assignment #3 from Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree.

For this project I used existing template provided by Udacity. This is a java script based game, so majority of the coding happened in .js files, mainly app.js. Index.html and .css files were edited too for additional functionality like the title, UI and leaderboard.

# Game rules
The goal of the game to reach water without hitting a bug as many times as possible. On every collision with a bug player loses one life.
* Player starts with 3 lives that are visible at the top left corner
* After reaching water player is reset to the beginning and ready to go again
* Hitting a bug will reset player position
* Collecting 3 jewels will add extra life. There's maximum of 5 lives at any moment.
* Every time player reaches water the game gets slightly harder by increasing the speed of bugs

After finishing a game player will be congratulated and given an opportunity to write his name.
There's a scoreboard, entries are added as they come. It is not stored anywhere else but the current page. It resets with a page refresh.
